Our love is alive and so we begin
Foolishly layin' our hearts on the table
Stumblin' in
Our love is a flame burnin' within
Now and then fire light will catch us
Stumblin' in

Wherever you go, whatever you do
You know these reckless thoughts of mine
Are followin' you

I've fallen for you
whatever you do
'Cause baby you've shown me so many things
that I never knew
